			<h1 >Welcome to CEP ‚Äì A Culinary Trip Through Colombia, Ethiopia & Peru</h1>
			<p>At CEP, we invite you to experience a flavorful journey through three vibrant cultures. Each dish on our menu tells a story‚Äîrooted in tradition, crafted with passion, and served with warmth.</p>
			<p>The only sport I really enjoy practicing is karate, though I haven‚Äôt been able to train lately due to a lack of time. When it comes to food, I‚Äôm not picky at all‚ÄîI can eat just about anything, as long as it‚Äôs not too spicy (I don‚Äôt handle spice very well). I also enjoy cooking when I have the time, partly because I like to know exactly what I‚Äôm eating, and partly because I just have a lot of fun doing it.</p>
			<p>Discover the richness of Colombian spices, the freshness of Peruvian cuisine, and the depth of Ethiopian flavors‚Äîall under one roof.</p>
			<p><b> Ready for a trip of new flavors?!!!!!</b></p>
